# Syssight

A real-time, multi-host performance monitoring tool. This project provides a central dashboard to visualize live and historical system metrics, view running processes, and receive alertsâ€”all powered by a lightweight agent, a Node.js backend, and an Angular frontend.

## Features

- **Lightweight Python Agent**:  
  A minimal-impact agent using `psutil` collects key system metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Load Average) from each monitored host.

- **Real-time Monitoring**:  
  The central dashboard displays live metrics from all connected hosts. Data is pushed continuously from agents to the server via Socket.io and broadcast to the dashboard for instant updates.

- **Historical Data Visualization**:  
  The server stores time-series metrics in MongoDB, allowing the dashboard to render interactive, historical graphs for CPU, memory, and network activity using Chart.js.

- **Host-Specific Views**:  
  Users can select any host from the dashboard to drill down into its specific live metrics and historical performance graphs.

- **On-Demand Process Viewer**:  
  You can request a paginated list of all running processes (including PID, name, CPU%, and Memory%) from a specific host at any time. This data is fetched on-demand and is **not stored** in the database to conserve resources.

- **Simple Frontend Alerting**:  
  The Angular dashboard generates a visual popup alert if any host's incoming metrics breach predefined client-side thresholds.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of three main parts:

### 1. Agent (`agent.py`)
- Python script that runs on each monitored Linux host.
- Uses `psutil` to collect system metrics at a configurable interval.
- Connects to the Node.js server via Socket.io to continuously push metric data.
- Listens for on-demand requests from the server (e.g., "get process list").

### 2. Server (`server.js`)
- Node.js/Express application acting as the central hub.
- Listens for Socket.io connections from agents and frontend.
- Receives metric data from agents, timestamps it, and stores it in MongoDB.
- Broadcasts live metrics to all connected dashboard clients.
- Provides REST APIs for the frontend to query historical data (for graphs).
- Relays on-demand requests (like "get processes") from the frontend to the specific agent.

### 3. Frontend (Angular)
- Single-page application serving as the user dashboard.
- Connects to the server via Socket.io to receive live metric broadcasts.
- Uses Chart.js to render graphs by fetching data from the server's REST API.
- Provides the UI for selecting hosts, viewing paginated process lists, and viewing alerts.
